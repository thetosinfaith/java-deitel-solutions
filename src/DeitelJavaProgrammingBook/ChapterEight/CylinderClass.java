//        Provide a method that calculates the cylinders’ volume, which
//        is pi multiplied by the square of the radius multiplied by the height.
//        It has set and get methods for both radius and height.
//        The set method should verify that radius and height are positive numbers.
//        Write a program to test class Cylinder.
    }

//    Yup Because you're going to collect radius and height as user input, so yeah, declare all of them as variables.
